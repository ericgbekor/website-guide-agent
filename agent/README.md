# Website Navigation Agent

This project implements an AI-powered website navigation agent for Fiction Solutions, a fictional technology company offering professional services including cloud solutions, mobile app development, and cybersecurity. The agent is designed to help users learn about the company's services and navigate the website efficiently.

## Overview

The Website Navigation Agent serves as an intelligent assistant for Fiction Solutions' website visitors. Built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and powered by the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, it provides real-time information about company services, guides users to relevant website sections, and engages in friendly, professional conversations. The agent dynamically fetches service data from backend APIs rather than using hardcoded responses.

## Agent Details

The key features of the Website Navigation Agent include:

| Feature            | Description          |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| _Interaction Type_ | Conversational       |
| _Complexity_       | Basic                |
| _Agent Type_       | Single Agent         |

  - Provides clear, actionable guidance

#### Tools

The agent has access to the following tools that enable dynamic data retrieval:

- **`get_website_services() -> dict`**: Retrieves the current list of services from the backend API
  - Endpoint: `{WEBSITE_API_URL}/website/services`
  - Returns live service data instead of hardcoded information
  - Includes error handling with timeout and retry logic

- **`get_website_navigation(section: str) -> dict`**: Returns navigation URLs for specific website sections
  - Endpoint: `{WEBSITE_API_URL}/website/navigation/{section}`
  - Provides direct links to website sections (pricing, contact, about, etc.)
  - Enables dynamic navigation based on current website structure

Both tools implement robust error handling, request timeouts (30 seconds), and proper logging for monitoring and debugging.

[Agent uses `get_website_navigation` tool with "pricing" section]

**Agent:** Here's the direct link to our pricing page: [https://fictionsolutions.com/pricing]. You'll find detailed pricing information for all our services there. Is there anything specific about our pricing structure you'd like me to help clarify?


## Configuration Management

Configuration is handled through [website_agent_service/config.py](./website_agent_service/config.py) using Pydantic settings:

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | GCP Project ID | `my_project` | Yes |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` | GCP Region | `europe-west2` | Yes |
| `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` | Use Vertex AI | `1` | Yes |
| `WEBSITE_API_URL` | Backend API URL | `""` | Yes |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google API Key | `""` | No |

## Cloud Deployment

### ðŸš€ Recommended: Using deploy.sh Script

The easiest way to deploy the Agent Service is using the included deployment script that handles Google Cloud Run deployment automatically:

1. **Configure deployment settings:**
   Edit `deploy.sh` and update the configuration section:
   ```bash
   # Set your Google Cloud Project ID
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
   
   # Set your desired Google Cloud Location
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"
   
   # Set the path to your agent code directory
   export AGENT_PATH="./website_agent_service"
   
   # Set a name for your Cloud Run service
   export SERVICE_NAME="website-agent-service"
   
   # Set an application name
   export APP_NAME="website-agent-app"
   ```

2. **Make script executable and deploy:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   The script will:
   - Deploy the agent to Google Cloud Run
   - Include web UI interface
   - Enable cloud tracing
   - Output the deployment URL and service details

### Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual deployment using ADK directly:

```bash
adk deploy cloud_run \
  --project="your-project-id" \
  --region="us-central1" \
  --service_name="website-agent-service" \
  --app_name="website-agent-app" \
  --with_ui \
  --trace_to_cloud \
  "./website_agent_service"
```

### Testing Deployment

After deployment, you can test the agent using the following methods:

#### Method 1: Web Interface
- Navigate to the Cloud Run service URL provided after deployment (typically: `https://website-agent-service-[hash]-uc.a.run.app`)
- Access the web UI to interact with the agent directly through the browser

#### Method 2: Health Check
```bash
# Check if the deployed service is running
curl https://your-service-url.run.app/

# The service should return a response indicating it's running
```

#### Method 3: Direct API Integration
If you need to integrate with the deployed agent programmatically, you can use the ADK client to connect to your Cloud Run service. The exact integration method will depend on your specific implementation needs.
